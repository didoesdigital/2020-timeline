              I created this timeline to make sense of the nonsense year. I
              couldn't recall the order of certain events, or get a sense of how
              much time had really passed. How long was lockdown really? So I
              recorded all the events that happened to myself and those around
              me living in Melbourne in 2020.

                  >The Year of Blur By Alex Williams - The New York Times</a
                >. This explains the brain fog, the strange sense of time, the
                drinking, the worrying, and other bizarre aspects of
                experiencing 2020.

                  Here are some of the things that happened throughout the year
                  that this timeline doesn't capture:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The ambiguity and fuzziness of rule changes and guidance.
                    While I've noted the major "lockdown" periods, there were
                    periods before, after, and in between when we were still
                    fairly significantly impeded. Between lockdowns, we were
                    technically allowed out to cafes, but strongly discouraged.
                    It was hard to know what to do.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The bushfire season in Australia that burned 18.6 million
                    hectares, destroyed over 5,900 buildings, killed at 34
                    people, and killed 3 billion animals.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The uncertainty of what risks we were taking leaving the
                    house when we knew so little about the disease and how it
                    was transmitted.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Every time we discovered a horrifying new symptom of the
                    COVID-19 disease.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When we stopped being able to make plans. The future was so
                    uncertain and there were so many restrictions that our
                    horizon shrunk down to a day or two at best.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Anxiety about shopping and buying food. How would we safely
                    acquire food to eat? How would we deal with panic buying?
                    Where would we get toilet paper from? How would we deal with
                    2-item limits? How would we deal with restrictions on online
                    grocery shopping? How would we manage dietary needs and
                    physical challenges?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Sewing masks, baking sourdough, and all the hobbies we
                    started.
                  </li>
                  <li>Deteriorating relations with China.</li>
                  <li>The wider racial justice movement.</li>
                  <li>
                    Everything else that happened abroad: Captain Sir Thomas
                    Moore raising £30 million for NHS Charities Together by
                    walking, climate change, Scotland making sanitary products
                    free, Trump's impeachment, Trump suggesting people drink
                    bleach to cure the coronavirus, the Harvey Weinstein
                    verdict, Kamala Harris as Democratic Vice President-Elect,
                    the US election, the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Brexit,
                    the COVID-19 toll, Ukrainian Boeing 737 plane crash in Iran,
                    Elliot Page announcing he is transgender, and so much more…

                I focused on events that I personally remember happening when it
                happened, rather than those I heard about later. I also focused
                on events that directly affected Victorians and Australians,
                especially in Melbourne.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                For rule changes implemented at 11.59pm, I rounded up to the
                next day, because that's when the rule started having an impact
                on me. I also focused on when rules came into effect rather than
                when they were announced, except where the announcement itself
                was significant.
